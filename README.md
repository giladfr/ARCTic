# ARCTic - ARC Tweaking Interface
## General

ARCTic is python based tool that enables the user to control the basic parts of the ASIC without any code running on the ARC by wrapping the JTAG debugger. It uses the chip programming model to generate a dynamic GUI with all the blocks, registers, fields and memories of the chip. You can read / write to every field or memory and also save a block state or a full chip state into an easy to read CSV file. 

## Motivation
The tool can enable various teams to start working and start validating the chip as soon as it lands in your lab without any need to write a single line of firmware code. It can also be used regularly by ASIC engineers in your lab to simplify testing parts of the ASIC without interrupting software engineers.

## Connection to target
In order to communicate with the ASIC the ARCTic wraps the Metaware debugger executable. It uses the command line mdb executable to pass basic read / write memory command to the JTAG TAP and display everything in a nice user interface. In general you can implement the basic interface functions which are read and write to memory above any other interface that you like and have the same functionally over SPI for example. 

## Features
* Attach / detach to target.
* Download code to target.
* Read / Write / Save / Refresh registers.
* Read / Write / Save / refresh block.
* Read and save the whole chip.
* Dump / Load and draw memory regions.
* Basic memory test.

## Installation
* Install python 2.7 32bit version.
* [Instal pyGTK using all in one installer.](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi)
* pip install matplotib
* pip install numpy
* git clone the repository or copy it to a local directory.
* Run "ARCTic.py <name_of_h_file>"

## SOC-online
The SOC-Online is a web based system developed by Synopsys to document the programming-model of the ASIC. ARCTic uses the C header file generated by this tool to create the chip model. The ASIC fields, registers, blocks and memory regions are all classes that sit under the chip model object.
